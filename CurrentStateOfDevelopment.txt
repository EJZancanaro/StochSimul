During developments older than the current project, it has been tried to migrate all code from python to C.
This was mostly successful, but the code contains memory leaks. We therefore continue this follow up project purely in Python.

Basic processes and functions were migrated to the current project.

Reading of "Interacting Hawkes processes with multiplicative inhibition" Céline Duval , Eric Luçon and Christophe Pouzat
They have their own project for hawkes_hawkes simulation https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/xtof/hawkes-x-hawkes/-/blob/master/code/hawkes_x_hawkes_simulation.pdf?ref_type=heads

Started Malliavin Calculus.

Tomorrow, look at Lectures on Poisson Processes

22/07:

Development of mutiple tests and basic functions. Tests on the correctness of the simulation of the Hawkes process still need to be corrected as they do not work in their current state
