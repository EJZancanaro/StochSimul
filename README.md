# StochSimul

This repository is currently being developed as an internship project by Eduardo de Jesus Zancanaro Garcia at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse and at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse. It is the follow up to another project developped during a previous internship that was not documented on GitHub. Not all its code has been integrated into this project, but a signifant part of it.

The most import file is MultipleNeuronSim.py. It is in this file that the neuron objects are defined. At the end of the file one can find a main that can be executed while playing around with some parameters.
Multiple tests are created but they are not exhaustive at all. Up to the current date (24/09/2025) the tests related to the "fast" version of functions fail, but this does not compromise the integrity of the code.

Some code might be superfluous but also unoptimized. It shall be cleaned some day.
