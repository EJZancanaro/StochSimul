# StochSimul

This repository is currently being developed as an internship project by Eduardo de Jesus Zancanaro Garcia at the Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse and at the Institut National des Sciences Appliquées de Toulouse. It is the follow up to another project developped during a previous internship that was not documented on GitHub. Not all its code has been integrated into this project, but a signifant part of it.

It aims to develop tools for stochastic simulations, particularly of self-exciting processes and Hawkes-inspired processes.
